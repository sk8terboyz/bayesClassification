## Bayes Classification

This code was created for a class I took where all code was developed on Linux servers.

This code was developed to fulfill homework requirements, not professional development.

Previous README (typically used to explain the program to peers or answer questions asked by the professor):

Program: bayesClassification.py
How to run: python3 bayesClassification.py

This program takes a .meta file, a .train file, and a .test file. It will need to be entered
in that order, but you can change the files at any point. It will take the info from the files
and store them in a set of arrays to then store all values and solutions. After this, it
will calculate the training data, and subsequently the testing data. The accuracy will be
outputted to the GUI for the user to see.
